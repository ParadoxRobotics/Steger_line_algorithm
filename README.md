# Steger_line_algorithm

Simple implementation in python of Steger algorithm to find curvilinear structure in a image.
this code use OpenCV 4.2.0 and Python 3.6.

Steger line : basic implementation of the stegger algorithm

Steger Line with Non-Max Supression : same implementation but with a non-max supression phase performed on the magnitude (gradient normal)
